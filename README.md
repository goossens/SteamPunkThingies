# Steampunk Thingies

Welcome to my library of Steampunk projects where tradional Steampunk meets
microcontrollers, 3D printing, simple electronics and some old fasioned woodworking.

## What is Steampunk

[Steampunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk) is an artistic movement
that combines Victorian-era history with modern technology and science fiction.
The term was first coined in 1987 by science fiction author
[K.W. Jeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._W._Jeter)
to describe a new wave of fantasy novels set in Victorian times.

Steampunk devices are retro-looking and they are often based on technologies that
people in the 19th and 20th centuries might have imagined, and are characterized
by their anachronistic nature (blatantly clashing with the time in which it is seen).

In my projects, old technologies like vacuum tubes, gauges, water/steam valves,
gas lines, analog dials/meters and even flux capacitors ðŸ˜Š are used (or simulated)
to create strange looking contraptions that serve at least one pratical purpose
like being a clock, desk lamp, charging station, weather station, environmental
sensor or smart home controller.
